I need to think of a way to dynamically generate all account types etc into a file from the picklist module
This should be able to be done under a settings page on frontend

1) enter login details
2) run picklist code:
create_picklist_module --username 'user@usernamespace.com' --password 'userpassword' atvar.py
3) Using the generated atvar.py use python to search for common strings and add them to custom dicts
4) Next up is to read input from user to determine the types to search for
